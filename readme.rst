Busara Challange

An application should allow registration and login of users. After login, users see a list of contacts with the metadata: name, phone number (international format) and age.

The application is developed in php(codeignitor) and bootsrap

it includes an sql file called busara for importation to your mysql. database name is busara.

after importation unzip the projext on your localhost folder and open application/config/database.php file and put in your myql configurations accorddingly. database username and password(if any).

once done run the project i.e load it in your browser localhost/{projectName} eg. http://localhost/busara

sign up and log in to the application

use new sql Busara(1).sql

I've added new an API for Login, creating, editing and deleting users kindly check install.txt for more details on how to use it
